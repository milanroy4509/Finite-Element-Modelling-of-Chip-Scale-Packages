# Finite Element Modelling of Chip Scale Packages

## Project Overview
Final-year thesis investigating the thermo-mechanical reliability of chip scale
packages (CSPs) with and without internal voids.

## Analysis Performed
- 3D finite element model development
- Thermal loading and cycling simulations
- Stress distribution comparison between voided and non-voided CSPs

## Key Findings
- Internal voids significantly influence stress distribution
- Thermo-mechanical loading increases reliability concerns in voided CSPs
- Numerical results aligned with theoretical expectations

## Tools Used
- ANSYS
- Finite Element Analysis
- Thermo-mechanical modelling
